# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

For our final project, we want to make a Minecraft Mod that offers more options for cooking. It would offer more food choices and potentially cooking options. Then, as a player, you can make actual meals and snacks. We plan to add more features as time progresses, such as drink options, health effects, and etc.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Lily Hewitt, Kayla Toner

## Do you have any questions of your own?

How many features should we add to manage complexity? We planned to start with food and expand based on time.
