# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Snack Break?

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Minecraft Mod that lets you buy, eat, and make food and drinks. We will provide more ingredients and cooking options.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Lilly Hewitt; tuo47895@temple.edu; TA: Joanne Nichols
Kayla Toner; tuo019418@temple.edu; TA: Zhenyu Zhao

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will create more meal and snack options with customizable options.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We think we can create various types of cooking options (oven, microwave, no-heat, etc). Only some ingredients will work for specific options. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We hope that we can add cooking options that affect the overall health effects/benefits of the food (i.e. food can burn, be undercooked, poisonous, etc). 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?

Lilly: Since we are working in Java, I need to review the syntax and basic foundation of the programming language. I need to research more about creating and implementing graphics to successfully make it a Minecraft Mod.
Kayla: I'll be looking into what mod software we will use to implement our code, and will need to refresh my memory on basic Java skills I learned last year. THe biggest thing I think I'll have to look into is inheritance.
