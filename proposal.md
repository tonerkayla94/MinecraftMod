# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Snack Break?

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Minecraft Mod that lets you buy, eat, and make food and drinks. We will provide more ingredients and cooking options.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We plan to use Intelligi, coding in Java, to create a Minecraft Mod. Our Mod will offer more food options for players, such as flour, salt, dough, and cheese. With more options, players can customize their snacks or meals. Our program will allow users to collect previous Minecraft food options and make recipes to create new foods. To achieve this, we are going to utilize Fabric to add more features to the game. We aim to add cooking options and health benefits that will either help or harm the player. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Lilly Hewitt; tuo47895@temple.edu; TA: Joanne Nichols
Kayla Toner; tuo019418@temple.edu; TA: Zhenyu Zhao

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We will create more meal and snack options with customizable options.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We think we can create various types of cooking options (oven, microwave, no-heat, etc). Only some ingredients will work for specific options. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We hope that we can add cooking options that affect the overall health effects/benefits of the food (i.e. food can burn, be undercooked, poisonous, etc). 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?

Our nexr steps is to learn more about graphics and inheritance. Lilly plans to review the syntax and basic foundation of Java. Additionally, she plans to research more on graphics, such as how to create and implement them into this program. Kayla plans to look into mod softwares we will use to implement our code. She is also going to refresh her memory on basic Java skills. She is going to research more into inheritance as it is a significant part of our program.
