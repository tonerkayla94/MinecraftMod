// This program was a lot more complex and difficult than we originally anticipated. We had problems implementing the graphics with only creating a item (placeholder) showing up but not the desired image. To resolve this, we watched a series of YouTube videos and tutorials, leading us to the discovery that we coded the incorrect pathway. After we fixed each item's pathway, all the items updated and implemented the images correctly. However, this did not fix our block (salt ore). We tried various different pathways and researched more about graphics and Fabric Mods, but ultimately could not find a solution. We discovered that there is not a lot of information on Fabric Mods, which made it difficult to program the syntax correctly or utilize built-in functions. 

Our problems with the basic computer graphics of our program led us to not reaching all of our goals. We did not have time to make new cooking options, but worked with the crafting table and furance features to create and cook our new foods. Creating a new table/cooking device was too advanced and we felt that it was unproductive to spend so much time learning how to code one feature. Thus, we focused on creating new recipes. After researching and understanding how to create recipes, we created unique recipes to create and incoporate our new items. We were successful at this and it became the center feature of our game. While we did not have the time to reach all our goals and increase the complexity of our program, we learned an exuberant amount about computer graphics, inheritance, and creating a video game.
